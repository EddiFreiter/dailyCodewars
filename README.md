# ⭐ Daily Coding Challenges ⭐

A repository for daily Codewars solutions.

## 🔎 Purpose and Goals 🥅

I love Codewars challenges. Once I start, I have a hard time stopping.
    * Learn new skills
    * Challenge myself to finish every solution by using troubleshooting tools and technics
    * Practicing daily = repetition and getting familiar coding langauges
    * A little #100Devs competition never hurts


My intention with using [Codewars](https://codewars.com) katas is, to learn JavaScript. By completing challenges I can learn and absorb proper syntax, new methods and troubleshooting at the same time. It's a learning tool and it's **FUN**!

Being part of the #100Devs group on [Codewars](https://codewars.com) also spices things up with a little friendly competition!
Who does not love that!?

My solutions will have the challenge name, description, my solution and test case. You can copy and paste and try it yourself.
