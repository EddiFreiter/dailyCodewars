# ⭐ Daily JavaScript Coding Challenges ⭐

A repository with my daily [Codewars](https://codewars.com) JavaScript solutions.<br>

## 🔎 Purpose and Goals 🥅

I love [Codewars](https://codewars.com) challenges. Once I start, I cannot stop.
* I learn new skills 🏗️
* I challenge myself to finish every solution 🎯
* I practice daily = repetition 💪
* I love a little [#100Devs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100Devs) competition 🏁, it never hurts


My intention with using [Codewars](https://codewars.com) katas is, to learn JavaScript well. By completing challenges I can learn and absorb proper syntax, new methods and troubleshooting skills, at the same time. It's a learning tool and it's **FUN**!

Being part of the [#100Devs](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100Devs) group on [Codewars](https://codewars.com) also spices things up with a little friendly competition! Who does not love that!?

My solutions have the challenge name, description, my solution and test case. Have a l👀k around.
