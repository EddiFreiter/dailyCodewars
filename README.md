# ⭐ Daily Coding Challenges ⭐

A repository with my daily Codewars solutions.<br>

## 🔎 Purpose and Goals 🥅

I love [Codewars](https://codewars.com) challenges. Once I start, I cannot stop.
* I learn new skills
* I challenge myself to finish every solution by using troubleshooting tools and technics
* I practice daily = repetition
* I love a little #100Devs competition, it never hurts


My intention with using [Codewars](https://codewars.com) katas is, to learn JavaScript well. By completing challenges I can learn and absorb proper syntax, new methods and troubleshooting skills at the same time. It's a learning tool and it's **FUN**!

Being part of the #100Devs group on [Codewars](https://codewars.com) also spices things up with a little friendly competition!
Who does not love that!?

My solutions will have the challenge name, description, my solution and test case. You can copy and paste and try it yourself.
